# text-memorizer
A gui program for memorizing text files with unicode support

To use, run the program with python 3+ and a gui will pop up. Use the first text box to enter the directory path, the second to enter the name of the text file and then hit preview to see the first 1000 words of the file on the screen. Then hit start and this will clear the screen so you can begin typing. To check if what you typed was correct then hit the check button. If it was correct then it will tell you and then you can preview the rest of the text and start again. 

The program will also produce a save file to keep track of where you are and a log file to keep track of your progress.
